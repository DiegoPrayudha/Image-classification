# Image Classification Project

This project is focused on classifying images into various categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The example shown below is a result of a classification model that was trained to distinguish between different scenes such as streets, mountains, buildings, sea, forest and glaciers.

## Project Overview

The key components of this project include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Preparation and augmentation of the image dataset.
2. **Model Building**: Construction of a CNN model using TensorFlow/Keras.
3. **Training and Evaluation**: Training the model on the dataset and evaluating its performance.
4. **Visualization**: Displaying the classification results and model architecture.

## Technologies Used
1. **TensorFlow**: For building and training the machine learning model.
2. **Google Colab**: For running the code and experiments.

## Approach
The project involves building a machine learning model to classify rice types. Two approaches were evaluated:
1. **Without Data Augmentation**: Using the raw dataset without any modifications.
2. **With Data Augmentation**: Applying various augmentation techniques to improve the model's performance and robustness.

## Result
The model's performance was evaluated using two different approaches: without data augmentation and with data augmentation.

1. Without Data Augmentation: The model was trained on the original dataset without any modifications. While the model performed reasonably well, there were some challenges in generalization, particularly on more varied or complex images.

2. With Data Augmentation: To enhance the model's robustness and improve generalization, various data augmentation techniques such as rotation, zoom, and horizontal flip were applied. This approach led to better performance, as the model was able to generalize more effectively to unseen images.
